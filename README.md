# react-codechallenge2-app
A react sample project as part of an adminission test

Coding challenge
Create an yarn or npm installable project that creates a list of users that allows you to delete users, a form to create or edit a user and store it in a database.
A user object has the following fields:
- Name
    - validated for maximum length
- Email 
    - validated as an email address
- City
    - Required. One of Amsterdam, SÃ£o Paulo, New York

Technologies to use
- React 16
- React Final Form or Redux Form
- React Redux
- Node 
- Express

Requirements for the solution:
- A boilerplate may be used, e.g. Razzle or React-Universally (next). However, keep in mind that we want to see your code and evaluate it. Any code not written by you will not be considered as your code.
- You should use eslint and prettier
- The solution should show how you handle in component state
- At least 1 unit test needs to be written to validate server side processing using either Mocha or Jest
- Form input needs to be validated before it's sent to the server
- You can use an ORM such as Mongoose or Sequelize
- Login protection is not necessary
- Visual Design is not relevant, but you are free to use nice looking UI libraries such as material-ui 
- Code is written using ES6 (server side code can be in ES5)
- When a user is added, the list should be updated

What we are looking for 
- We like clean, re-usable, compact code
- We understand that this is a test project and not everything has to be perfect
- We like the correct use of PureComponent and Functional components
- How you apply the REST endpoints on the server side
